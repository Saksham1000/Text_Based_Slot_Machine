ðŸŽ° Text-Based Slot Machine (Python)
This is a simple terminal-based slot machine game developed in Python. The game allows players to deposit money, choose how many horizontal lines (up to 3) they want to bet on, and specify a custom bet amount per line. Once the bet is placed, the player spins a 3x3 slot machine filled with randomly selected symbols based on predefined frequencies. If a player matches the same symbol across a bet line, they win an amount calculated using symbol-based payout multipliers. The game includes features such as balance tracking, dynamic symbol distribution, and informative feedback on winnings and losses after each spin.

A (2 instances) â†’ 5Ã— payout
